# Working directory for PDL course

This uses a conda environment called pdl_p  (practical deep learning practice)
So far installed is:

```
conda install jupyter
conda install -c fastai fastai
conda install -c fastai nbdev
conda install gradio
```

This is CPU only, which suits me just fine. 

I alos have pdl_gpu which has gpu installed: 
```
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia 
conda install jupyter
conda install -c fastai fastai

```
 
Note make sure to update / upgrade with conda before doing this .
