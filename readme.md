# Working directory for PDL course

This uses a conda environment called pdl_p  (practical deep learning practice)
So far installed is:

```
conda install jupyter
conda install -c fastai fastai
conda install -c fastai nbdev
```

This is CPU only afaik, which suits me just fine. If you want gpu you need to do pytorch seperately
 
Note make sure to update / upgrade with conda before doing this .
