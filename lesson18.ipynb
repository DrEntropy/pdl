    "* First part of lesson goes through SGD, Momentum, RMSProp, Adam and Adam with annealing using a spreadsheet (graddesc.xlsm). \n",

    "* Adam works so much better it is quite suprising to me. After one or two runs you have to lower the learnign rate to keep it from bouncing around.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adam with annealing attempts to reduce the learning rate as the training progresses.\n",
    "    * Keeps track of lowest squared gradient.\n",
    "    *  If the current squared gradient is more than 1/2 the lowest, then it reduces the learning rate by a factor of 4.\n",
    "    * This was implemented in VBA code in the spreadsheet. Works quite well! \n",
