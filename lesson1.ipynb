    "## Lesson 1 - Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson was primarily about 'getting started' (hence the title).   Some highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pretrained models help make this 'fast', and allow you to train models without 'Big Data'\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use cloud computing (Kaggle, Colab, Paperspace) to do training. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The rest was a whirlwind tour / demo of fastai and deep learning in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was also a ['Is it a Bird?'](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data) practice notebook, which is a good test that you have things working. It is designed for use on Kaggle.  I found that it *didn't* work, because the duck duck go api had changed since that notebook was written, but it is easily fixed (there is a comment on the kaggle notebook on how to do it). \n",
